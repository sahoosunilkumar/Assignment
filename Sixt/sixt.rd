At http://www.codetalk.de/cars.json you get a JSON list of cars with some basic information.
Implement an Android app, that downloads this file and use all information available that you think makes sense to display:
Displays these cars in a list.
Displays these cars on a map.
Note: The carImageUrl is not up to date anymore, therefore, you can get the correct URL to the car image using this pattern:
https://prod.drive-now-content.com/fileadmin/user_upload_global/assets/cars/{modelIdentifier}/{color}/2x/car.png
 
In case there are still images missing, use a fallback.
You may use any external frameworks / libraries you like, just add a short note why you chose this one and what you use it for.
Focus more on architecture, structure & clean code, less on design.
Â·  You can share the code with us in any way you prefer, zip file, Github, Bitbucket
 
Best of luck with the assignment.
